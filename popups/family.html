    Try to record how much time you are spending in work and personal activities; if work starts to creep into non-work life,
    take steps to ensure that you are establishing clear boundaries. Conversely, if home life tasks are intruding at work,
    this can reduce your effectiveness during your time at work, extending the amount of time needed to complete work tasks.
